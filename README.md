# IceTools

The icetools suite is built around the icestorm project by Clifford Wolf.

## TL;DR

The tools have been packaged in a docker image available both on the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dimdm/icetools/) and on [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/dimdm/icetools).

```
docker run dimdm/icetools icepack --help
```

## Tools

1. icestorm for working with iCE40 bitstream files
2. arachne-pnr for place and route
3. yosys for Verilog RTL synthesis
4. iverilog for Verilog simulation
